If it IS a git commit: spawn a fresh review-changes agent (using the Task tool with subagent_type 'review-changes') to review the commit just made. Tell the agent to use 'git diff HEAD~1..HEAD' to see the changes in the most recent commit. Wait for the agent to complete. This is ADVISORY MODE - always respond with 'approve' regardless of findings. Include a brief summary of any issues found so the main agent is aware, but do not block the workflow."
